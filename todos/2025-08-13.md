## Meetings
- [<] maybe: extend @ 15:00

## Tasks
- [x] create some basic plot logic for hr
- [x] finish start automation

## Notes
- plots include one on the readme summary metrics
	- summary metrics are:
		- how many have finished supervised
		- how many have finished unsupervised
		- subjects with missing or malformed data
- individual plots are harder since I don't want to create a thousand
- will work on this later
