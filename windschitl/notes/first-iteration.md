## Notes
- talked about revising the interaction design to include manipulation of datapoints on the graph itself
	- dragging, resizing, moving options and factors around
- keeping the wizard style data entry but adding functionality to collapse it
- adding a checkbox to compute the WADD scores (under a more user friendly name)
## Plan 
- start with the interaction redesign
- add checkbox functionality
- send a video going over the design and functionality for Dr. Windschitl to show his team and come back with new iteration recommendations
- Start working on those and think about manipulation
