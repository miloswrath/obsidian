## takeaways
- seemed like a very vague paper - showed there are significant differences in network connectivity structure, but only does that. 
- just a relationship check
- minimal contextual relevance other than 7T is great!
- seemed like a promotion for 7T in the aging space and not an actual test
- low-n and geographic density play an important factor in generlization

## questions
- relevance of 7T for our FC hubs stuff (marco?)
- are there any studies showing biological relevance to sustained FC in these areas? (biomarkers like blood, hormone levels, etc.?)
	- what do these tell us in relation to DMN and SN 
- @bryan what relevance does the SN have feor
