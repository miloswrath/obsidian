Its time to get artsy fartsy HCI style again. Next Monday we discuss this banger.

## Notes
> ([[vis.pdf#page=1&selection=15,45,23,5&color=note|p.1]])
> In this study, the researcher explores the effects of different data visualizations on user motivation within self-tracking mobile applications. Through design space analysis and semi-structured interviews, the researcher defines a set of design factors that impact users’ exercise motivation at different levels of exercise adoption. Based on these factors, the researcher delivers a set of practical design suggestions for design practitioners and people who create visualizations for large data sets.
Good for a first slide of course

*why visualizations?*
> ([[vis.pdf#page=1&selection=106,18,113,2&color=yellow|p.1]])
> Visualizations are a crucial tool that make data accessible, intelligible, engaging, and impactful [ 6, 7].
> ([[vis.pdf#page=2&selection=9,0,26,2&color=yellow|p.2]])
> Extensive research shows that visualizations are powerful tools that make data accessible [14], engaging [ 7], memorable [ 15 ], intelligible [16 ], and impactful [6 ].

*I have no idea why neuroscience papers aren't organized like this its so goodh.

this is a good figure for explaining conceptual framework
![[vis.pdf#page=2&rect=62,484,549,703|vis, p.2]]
this can be used to explain how the research questions are addressed and where the theories fit into the pipeline


This is an important table to summarize what the researcher did. 
![[vis.pdf#page=3&rect=36,77,579,346|vis, p.3]]

important to note they did not include any os specific applications or garmin
![[vis.pdf#page=4&rect=44,582,563,715|vis, p.4]]
*reasons why*
> ([[vis.pdf#page=4&selection=118,14,119,57&color=red|p.4]])
> only applications with a rating higher than four and with reviews totaling more than 1,000 are considered.
quality apps only
> ([[vis.pdf#page=4&selection=120,0,127,39&color=red|p.4]])
> 4. Target applications are downloadable for free (for the consideration of accessibility/affordability). 
> 5. Target applications do not rely on devices other than mobile phones to process their core functions.
> free and phone only


This is an interesting strategy that i have never seen used before
> ([[vis.pdf#page=6&selection=7,28,10,7&color=note|p.6]])
> n particular, each participant received an email with a summary of his/her interview session. Participants replied to the emails to confirm or clarify the interpretation details. 


### Findings
#### Phase 1
*go through each design type*

#### Phase 2
go through each factor in *4.2.1*
> ([[vis.pdf#page=7&selection=75,0,78,0&color=important|p.7]])
> 4.2.1 Motivational Design Factors (MDFs).

in terms of applicability - intenders and actors are the most relevant for reports
> ([[vis.pdf#page=9&selection=51,0,71,66&color=red|p.9]])
> Intenders Intenders are at the stage of exploring exercise. Unlike Preintenders, Intenders have thoughts about starting exercise. According to the interview data, the main barriers to motivating Intenders to exercise are (1) not knowing their exercise goals, and (2) not being confident in exercising. Interview results showed that the top four MDFs prioritized by Intenders are: ‘Data/graph reliability’, ‘visualized goals’, ‘visualized progress’, and ‘visualized completion and consistency’. Actors Actors have ideas about what they want to achieve through exercise. They are capable of interpreting their workout data. Additionally, they can adjust their workout plans according to their performances. The researcher found that actors use data visualizations and tracking data as their tools instead of depending on them. Interview results showed that the top four MDFs prioritized by Actors are: ‘Data/graph reliability’, ‘visualized goals’, ‘a holistic view of connections and relationships’, and ‘visualized progress’.

#### preintenders
> ([[vis.pdf#page=9&selection=92,23,93,11&color=important|p.9]])
> they need to understand why they want to exercise

> ([[vis.pdf#page=9&selection=102,24,103,38&color=important|p.9]])
> hey could not interpret the technical terms used in the data visualizations.

> ([[vis.pdf#page=9&selection=112,48,116,11&color=important|p.9]])
> isualized instructions on what the user needs to do and how to do a particular exercise correctly can help Preintenders gain knowledge on doing exercises and build up confidence while exercising.

#### intenders
> ([[vis.pdf#page=10&selection=36,38,38,54&color=important|p.10]])
> a subtle change of the frame can significantly influence users’ interpretations, opinions, and responses to a piece of data visualization [


#### actors
> ([[vis.pdf#page=10&selection=61,19,64,18&color=important|p.10]])
> very used to looking at precise data and exact numbers. Seeing details from the data visualization made them trust the data more and make realistic plans to avoid frustration.

> ([[vis.pdf#page=10&selection=69,49,70,30&color=important|p.10]])
> where they are and where they want to be.

## presentation outline


---

## 1. Title & Opening (3 min)

- **Slide 1:**
    
    - Paper title, your name/affiliation, date.
        
    - **Motivational hook:** A striking visualization (e.g., animated goal tracker).
        

---

## 2. Background & Theoretical Foundations (10 min)

### 2.1 Data Visualization & Persuasion (3 min)

- **Key point:** Visual treatments amplify cognition and shape attitudes.
    
- **Evidence:** “Visual treatments…have a stronger and more positive impact on persuasion attitude change than tables” .
    
- **Artsy tip:** Show “framing” examples side-by-side (70 % full vs. 30 % empty).
    

### 2.2 Self-Determination Theory (SDT) (4 min)

- **Core needs:**
    
    - Competence (confidence, mastery)

    - Autonomy (self-directed choice)

## 6. Design Recommendations (5 min)

- **For Preintenders:**

    2. Simplify labels & annotations.
        
    3. Straightforward visual instructions .
        
- **For Intenders:**
    
    1. Break goals into milestones.
        
    2. “Spirit-lifter” frames to boost self-efficacy (gain vs. loss framing [10]).
        
- **For Actors:**
    
    1. Drill-down views on metrics.
        
    2. Narrative self-journey dashboards .
