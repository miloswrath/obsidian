There are two main potential approaches to solving issues where a single metric has its own bias
## Statistical Ensemble

- use a mix of two or more metrics and provide a weighted consensus technique to mitigate the false negative subtle static posture changes in ENMO
## Machine Learning
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11495570/
- Simulate data trhough physics based models (add noise to low amplitude sine waves for standing sway?) or data driven models (SMOTE) ensure labels are accurate via domain rules
- Train models on ENMO and Neishabouri counts then stack or vote
- Can boost sensitivity

## Main Choice 
If interpretability is key, start with non-ML ensembles (e.g., consensus cut-points). For higher accuracy, use ML with synthetic augmentationâ€”it's robust if synthetics faithfully replicate distributions (validate via KS-tests). Combine with posture metrics (e.g., Anglez) for even better standing detection.

## Implementation in GGIR
- can use external functions in GGIR for at least parts 1 and 2 but I asked the GGIR group if it will use the external function as main metrics in parts 3 -> 6


## Problems with sampling frequency

Paper found that as frequency lowered there was less light activity and sleep classified (when relying on guider this would end up going to sedentary for us)

machine learning methods have higher accuracy when using low sampling frequency

Some evidence points to the need for advanced ML to correctly classify with wrist worn devices
