## What i did this week

#### HR Data
- I finished the QC logic outlined during meetings with Hayley and Olivia
- Generated an output file for the QCs
	- currently there aren't any scary qc outputs - just some notes on how data was collected not that any is truly missing
- started  writing a pipeline for plotting the data
	- Staying away from individual plots since there would be 120\*264 of them
	- wrote an OLS model in rust to run correlations between supervised and unsupervised adherence.
		- rust allows for low computational cost and portability
		- its good to know if there is a relationship or not between the two measures but also to see where people are trending
		- future iterations might have covariates
		- might even turn this into a cli tool for the team to run simple ols, binomial, or wls models on demand since its so fast and easy
	- have the opportunity to do more descriptive plots as well. 
	- used D3 (javascript library) to plot predictions and residuals from the OLS model
- started designing more descriptive visualizations in Figma, total completed supervised and unsupervised (out of 264 goal) - total riding the 20% adherence line for supervised - distribution of adherence in unsupervised

#### Started WMH-synthseg QC
 - after looking at how many were way too high - looking at skull stripping artifacts as main culprit
 - looked at a few lst-ai subject tests (5 from extend, better, and pacrad) and saw that its nowhere near as good as synthseg

#### A note on the generative ai paper you sent
- i fundamentally disagree with this paper
- they get lost in the sauce between generative AI and machine learning
- using AI to code is useless on a one shot basis - which they suggest in the paper
	- these tools are meant to solve pieces of the puzzle not the entire thing
- Generative AI can't do quality control because QC isn't image generation - if anything ML can do it with deep learning but still doesn't make sense
- Surprised this got through review
