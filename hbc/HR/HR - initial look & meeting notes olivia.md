## notes for graph and information creation

> its important to find the minimum amount of information that would be useful since there would be way too many graphs to do all sessions

- [I] need to focus on QA and trends

### known useful info
- total time of training - including warm up and cool down
- total sessions *which is the max number in supervised*
- total missed sessions *the max # minus the length of files in dir*

### still needs work
- what checks for quality are needed
- what do they look at for trends
